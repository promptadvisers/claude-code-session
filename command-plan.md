# Plan Command

I want to plan: $ARGUMENTS

Help me create a clear plan by:

1. **Understanding the Goal**
   - What am I trying to achieve?
   - Why is this important?
   - What does success look like?

2. **Breaking It Down**
   - List the main steps needed
   - Identify what order to do them in
   - Estimate how long each might take

3. **Identifying Resources**
   - What tools or agents could help?
   - What information do I need?
   - Are there examples I can follow?

4. **Creating Next Steps**
   - What should I do first?
   - What might be challenging?
   - How will I know I'm on track?

Format the plan in a clear, easy-to-follow way.
Save it as `PLAN-[topic].md` so I can refer back to it.

Keep it practical and encouraging!
